.HELP

	    MSGBLD is a utility program which converts a user 
	    supplied help message file into an index file in the 
	    proper format for TAE HELP-MESSAGE processing.
 
	    The help message file is a text file, 
	    consisting of message keys and the associated help 
	    text in the following format:
	
	    	.key	key-x
		textline-1
 	 	.
 		.			(for key x)
 		textline-n
.PAGE
	    The output message index file consists of a single record
	    for each of the messages defined in the help message file. 
	    These records contain the key and pointers to the record in 
	    help message file containing the help text.

	    Any time the message file is updated, 
	    the MSGBLD utility must be invoked to create a new 
	    index file.
 
 	    The file name of the help message file must end in the 
	    characters "FAC". The file type must be ".MSG". The 
	    file is located in the library specified 
	    in  the input filespec. The message index file has 
	    the same name as the text file with the type ".INX". 
	    It is created in the same library where the message file exists.

.variable FILE



	    "FILE" specifies the name of the message text file
	    containing detailed help information for TAE messages
	    output by the application processes or procedures.

	    The maximum length of the file name is 80 characters. The 
	    last three characters of the file name must be "FAC".
	    The file type must be ".MSG", and therefore may be
	    omitted. If no library is specified, user's default
	    library is assumed.
