   #	command procedure to compile a FORTRAN program with
#	include files references from TAE library $TAEINC.
#
# Change Log:
# 18-nov-92	PR 1718: On some platforms (i.e. Ultrix and SGI), the suffix
#		supplied for basename is a regular expression.  Thus
#		"basename minwptc .c" will result in "minwp".  Need to
#		backslash the ".".  Also need to put the suffix in quotes
#		for the SGI...cew
# 03-jun-93	TINC changed to TAEINC, $TAE/inc to $TAE/include...kbs

incsubst $1 '$TAEINC' $TAE/include tmp.f 
				#substitute for include file names
				#and create a temporary file
f77 -c -g tmp.f			#compile the temporary file
if test "$TAEPLAT" = mipsel || test "$TAEPLAT" = sgi
then
    mv tmp.o `basename $1 '\.f'`.o	#rename the object file
else
    mv tmp.o `basename $1 .f`.o		#rename the object file
fi
#test $? -eq 0 && echo "** compiled $1 **"	#print message
rm tmp.f			#delete the temporary file
