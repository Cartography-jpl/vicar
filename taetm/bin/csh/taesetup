# Standard setup of environment for TAE Plus users and developers.
#
# It is recommended that you source this file in your .cshrc file
#
# We no longer automatically extend your path, so you will have to add
# the following directories to your path variable AFTER sourcing this
# file: $TAEBIN. For example, your .login could contain the line:
#
# 		path = ($path $TAEBIN)
#
# If your TAE installation has kept the demos, and you want to be able
# to execute demos like other commands, add this to your path variable
# as well: $TAEDEMOBIN

# A note on new logical names. All new logicals defined with this
# release begin with $TAE. The $T prefix may not be sufficient for
# eliminating collisions with other packages, so all $T logicals will
# eventually be retired. We've removed as many as we could. The ones
# that are left are for backwards compatibility only and may someday
# disappear. Any new references you make to logicals should use the
# $TAE name.
