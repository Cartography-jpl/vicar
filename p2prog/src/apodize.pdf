"apodize"
.HELP
PURPOSE:
"apodize" modifies picture borders so that the Fourier transform of the
picture will be free of spikes through the zero-frequency axis, allowing
filters to operate without ringing on the picture peripheries.

 
EXECUTION:

Examples

apodize IN OUT

This command will perform the operation on input image IN, sending the output
to image OUT.  The input image is assumed to be in byte format; a ten-pixel
border will be used. 

apodize IN OUT EDGE=3

This command is similar, but a three-pixel border is used.

OPERATION:
The Fourier transform considers the input picture to really be an infinite
mosaic (checkerboard) of identical pictures.  If the picture borders do not
match but cause abrupt DN displacement, this information is included in the
transform as a broad response on a line through DC both vertically and
horizontally.  When restoration filters are applied, this information (which
has not partaken of the image degradation in question) is altered.  The inverse
Fourier transform no longer contains the information needed to represent a
clean picture border and ringing is the result. 

"apodize" fits a sine wave across the picture border so that abrupt transitions
in the mosaic become continuous.  The EDGE parameter controls the wavelength
such that lambda = 4 * EDGE.  All information within the border strip is lost.
