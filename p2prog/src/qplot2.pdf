.TITLE
Line or spectral plots to VRDI, Tektronix, Regis, Printronix
.HELP
Purpose:  QPLOT2 plots the DN values along a specified straight line through
  an image.  It also does spectral plots for multi-channel data. The common
  plotting routines are used to send the plots either to a file for later
  hardcopy, or to a plotting capable quicklook device such as a REGIS or
  TEKTRONIX terminal or a VRDI image display device.  The PLOTTING command
  is used to select the output device type. Possible devices are:

        Quicklook:
          IMAGE:      A VRDI image display device
          TEKTRONIX:  A Tektronix compatible terminal.
          REGIS:      A REGIS compatible terminal (VT240, VT241, VT125)
        
        Hardcopy: (Note: Files are not automatically printed)
          PRINT:      A PRINTRONIX P-series printer
                       (Output file PRINTRONX.PLT)
          LASER:      A Talaris QUIC-based laser printer
                      *** This is not currently supported ***
                       (Output file LSRPLT01.Q)
          CALCOMP:    *** See the cognizant engineer for the CALCOMP 
                      *** for instructions.

Parameters:  There are two types of parameters:

      (1) Parameters with a single specification:
		INP		NCHAN
		TITLE		LOTITLE		XTITLE
		YTITLE		LABELSIZ	LOLABEL
		NORM		RDS		DISPLACE
		XLENGTH		YLENGTH
		XSCALE		YSCALE
      (2) Parameters which have a specification for each line plotted:
		PROCESS		SPROCESS
                XVALUES         YVALUES

Restrictions:
  (1) Maximum number of lines plotted is 10.
  (2) Maximum x axis length is 6 feet. (On PRINTRONIX)
  (3) Maximum y axis length is 12 inches. (On PRINTRONIX)
  (4) Spectral plots require a single input in mss format.

Note:  This program makes use of multiple intermediate data sets which are
  deleted when the program executes normally.  If this program is run under
  a default directory which does not allow the creation of these files
  (either because of disk quotas or protection) the program will die a
  horrible death and the plot file will not be created.  Also if for some
  reason other than this, the program dies a horrible death, there could
  be a couple of miscellaneous files laying around.

.vari nodisp
Option to suppress display and create
postscript file instead.
.vari plotout
Name of the output postscript file.
.level2
.variable inp
Input data set; maximum number of 10.
.variable process
Specifies one or more lines to be plotted. Following the keyword,
each plot is specified by a set of five numbers. The first value in
each set specifies the Input Data Set Number and the remaining four
values specify the Starting Line, Starting Sample, Ending Line, and Ending
Sample. (No Default).  NOTE:  The line plotted will cover
SQRT((EL-SL)**2+(ES-SS)**2) "relative samples" along the horizontal axis
and will start at "relative sample" 1.
.variable nchan
Specifies the number of spectral channels in an input data set in mss
format. This keyword is used in conjunction with the SPROCESS keyword.
(Default is 1)
.variable sprocess
Specifies one or more spectral plots. This keyword requires that the input
be in mss format and that NCHAN is specified. Following the keyword,
each spectral plot is specified by a set of two numbers. The first value
in each set specifies the Line and the second value the Sample of the
point within the first channel through which the spectral plot is to be
done. (No Default)
.variable title
Used to specify the title of plots (Max length of 52 characters).
(Default is 'IPL LINE PLOT', or for spectral plots, 'IPL SPECTRAL PLOT')
.variable lotitle
Specifies that the title will be written within the 8.5 x 11 area
(if the y axis length is less than or equal to 7 inches). (Default
is to place the title at the top of the page)
.variable xtitle
Specifies the title for the X axis (Max length of 52 characters). (Default is
'Relative Sample Number')
.variable ytitle
Specifies the title for the Y axis (Max length of 52 characters). (Default is
'DN Value')
.variable labelsiz
Specifies the height in inches of the label characters. For a value
of 0.0, no labels are printed. (Default is 0.12)
.variable lolabel
Specifies that labels will be written within the 8.5 x 11 space.
(Default is to place the labels at the top of the page.)
.variable norm
Causes DN values to be scaled linearly so that the largest value
becomes 1.  The length of the y axis is set to 5 inches.
(Default is that this is not done.)
.variable rds
Causes DN values to be scaled by the following equation:
OUT=SQRT(IN**2-RDS**2). (Default is that this is not done)
.variable displace
Specifies that subsequent lines on the same plot will be displaced
by the given amount.  This is specified in terms of the final plotted
vertical values, rather than input DN, in the cases where the input
values are scaled. (Default is 0.0)
.variable xlength
Specifies the length in inches of the X axis. (Default is 9.0; Max is 72.0)
.variable ylength
Specifies the length in inches of the Y axis. (Default is 7.0; max is 12.0)
.variable xscale
Specifies the scale used along the X axis.  The X axis will be drawn going
from a minimum of the first value to a maximum of the second.  The defaults
for these values are obtained by determining the minimum and maximum X
values to be plotted on the axis and then passing these values to the
subroutine SCALE.
SCALE determines the scaling so that 1 inch along the axis will always be
an interval of 1,2,3,4,5,6 or 8*(10**n) units.  This usually results in
having the plotted lines occupy only a portion of the axis.  By using the
XSCALE keyword the user can force plots to occupy a greater portion of the
X axis.  Axis values are printed every inch, however, and if it is desired
that these values be nice round numbers the quantity:
                  (XSCALEMAX-XSCALEMIN)/XLENGTH
should be a nice round number.
.variable yscale
Specifies the scale used along the Y axis.  The Y axis will be drawn going
from a minimum of the first value to a maximum of the second.  The defaults
for these values are obtained by determining the minimum and maximum Y
values to be plotted on the axis and then passing these values to the
subroutine SCALE.

an interval of 1,2,3,4,5,6 or 8*(10**n) units.  This usually results in

that these values be nice round numbers the quantity:
                  (YSCALEMAX-YSCALEMIN)/YLENGTH
should be a nice round number.
.variable xvalues
Allows the user to rescale the actual x (sample) data values of the
lines to be plotted. XVALUES is followed by two real values specifying the
minimum and maximum x values. The first value (the minimum) is the point
along the X axis where the first data point will be plotted.  The second
value (the maximum) is the point along the X axis where the last data
point will be plotted.
(DEFAULTS: XMIN=1.0, XMAX=SQRT[(EL-SL)**2+(ES-SS)**2]+1
.variable yvalues
Allows the user to rescale the actual y (DN) data values of the lines
to be plotted. YVALUES is followed by groups of two real values, one
group for each line to be plotted. The two values in each group specify the
minimum and maximum y values. The first value (the minimum) is the point
along the Y axis where a DN of zero will be plotted.  The second value
(the maximum) is the point along the Y axis where a DN of 255 (32767
for halfword data) will be plotted.
(DEFAULT: YMIN=0.0, YMAX=255 (byte) YMAX=32767 (halfword)   )

.vari plotout
The name of the output postscript file if NODISP specified.

Note that this file will always be created, but it will be empty unless
NODISP is specified.
