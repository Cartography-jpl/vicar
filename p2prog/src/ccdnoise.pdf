VICAR2 Program CCDNOISE
.HELP
PURPOSE:

CCDNOISE determines the system gain constant (in electrons per DN) and
read-noise floor (DN) for a CCD camera system.  The program is one of
a series of programs designed to support radiometric calibration of flight
imaging systems.

Vicar Plotting

The Vicar Plotting system can produce plots on a display device if required.
The plotting system always generates a postscript file suitable for plotting on 
either a hard copy device or a display device. The postscript file can be 
defaulted to a system derived name or can be explicitly named by the user.  

The user can run plotting programs either interactively or in batch.  Whether 
or not plots are required, a plotting device (node) must be specified. This may
or may not be the plotting device the user requires.  To override the system 
defaulted device, the user must select a display device.  This is implemented 
from an Alpha using the following following:
           set display/create/trans=tcpip/node=poconos.  
This allocates a UNIX workstation named "poconos". If the user is on an Alpha
and wishes to plot to a UNIX workstation, the user first type: 
           xhost coda2 
where coda2 is the name of the Alpha from which plots will be sent.  
.PAGE
To plot on a UNIX workstation, the user needs to type on the UNIX workstation
           setenv DISPLAY poconos:0.0
which allocates the UNIX workstation named "poconos".      
Note: poconos and coda2 are examples of nodes.  The user may send and direct 
plots from and to any node he chooses.  

Interactively, either on the command line or in a pdf, the user may decide 
decide whether or not to plot the graphics.   If the user requires only a hard
copy, he must add 'nodisp to the program command line.   This will inhibit the 
plotting of the graphics on a display device.  

In batch, the user may not request plots on a display device.  Only postscript
files will be produced.  In order to generate postscript files in batch mode , 
the user MUST allocate a display device from WITHIN the batch script.  If the 
user fails to do this, no postscript files will be produced.

EXECUTION:

	      CCDNOISE INP=LTF OUT=MARK PARMS

The input is a Light Transfer File (LTF) containing statistical data for
specified areas in the image for each exposure of a light transfer
sequence.  The LTF must have been previously initialized via LTGEN and
loaded with data via MOMGEN.

The output is an optional MARK-format tiepoint data set containing the
centers of all rejected areas (see VICAR program MARK).

.PAGE 
OPERATION:

CCDNOISE performs the following steps:

  1) Read data from the Light Transfer File.
  2) Compute system gain constant and read noise for each area.
  3) Compute mean value for system gain constant and read noise
     and flag all areas deviating by more than 2 sigma from the mean.
  4) Re-compute the mean value for system gain constant and read
     noise, ignoring all flagged values as specified by the REJECT
     parameter.

The mean signal for a frame is computed by subtracting the dark current
from the frame and computing the mean of the result.  If extended
exposure mode frames are present in the light transfer sequence (possible
for Galileo data), then the extended exposure dark current is subtracted 
from these frames.

If extended exposure mode frames exist, the EXTEXPO parameter must normally
be specified to indicate the exposure level at which the extended exposures
begin.

   Example:  EXTEXPO=7 specifies that the 7th exposure level (above the
	     dark current) begins the extended exposures.

However, light-transfer sequences consisting entirely of extend-exposure
frames should be input as if they were normal exposures, i.e. the extended-
exposure dark-current should be inserted in place of the normal dark-current
and the EXTEXPO parameter should not be used.

CCDNOISE prints out the following:

  1) System gain constant and read noise for each area specified.
  2) Summary of all areas flagged for bad system gain or read noise.
  3) If DBUG is specified, a summary of the mean signal and noise (DN)
     at each exposure for each area specified.

If an output file is specified, then the centers of all flagged values
as specified by the REJECT parameter are stored in a MARK-format data
set.

If a PLOT file is specified, a signal vs. noise plot is generated for
each of the five reticles of the frame.  The reticles are (1) the upper-
left corner, (2) upper-right corner, (3) lower-left corner, (4) lower-right
corner, and (5) center of the frame.  These reticles divide the frame into
five regions.  Signal and noise data for the reticles are computed by 
averaging the good areas, where each area is assigned to the region of
the nearest reticle.  The plot file should be printed using the NOFEED
option (see example below).

A table of the values used to create each plot is also printed out.  This
table includes the ratio of measured vs. computed noise at each exposure.
The noise (DN) is computed as follows:

	NOISE = SQRT(S/K + RDN**2)

where S = signal (DN)
      K = system gain constant (electrons per DN)
      RDN = read noise (DN)

This ratio provides a useful criteria for evaluating the quality of the
input data (ratio should be near 1 for all exposures). 

If a TABLE file is provided, the above plots will be output as columnar
data in a tab-delimitted ASCII file.  The columns are:

  exposure time in msec
  signal reticle 1, 
  noise ret. 1, 
  computed noise ret. 1,
  ....,  
  signal ret. 5, 
  noise ret. 5,
  computed noise ret. 5

The rows are for each exposure level.
