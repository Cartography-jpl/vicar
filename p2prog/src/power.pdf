 VICAR Application program POWER
.HELP
 "POWER" computes the 1 - dimensional power spectrum of a specified portion of 
  a picture.  

  Although the output is called 'power spectrum', the value computed is
  the square root of the power spectrum (the peak-to-peak amplitude in DN).
  Therefore, strictly speaking the output is an 'amplitude spectrum'.
  
  This output can be:
  1.  Written to a plot file which can be plotted on a POSTSCRIPT printer 
      or other POSTSCRIPT device.
  2.  Plotted directly to an X image display device.
  3.  Written as a tab-delimited ASCII file for use by commmerical packages.

 OPERATION:
  
  POWER uses the fast Fourier Transform to produce the power spectrum of each
  line of a specified portion of an input picture.  POWER produces a single 
  resultant power spectrum by averaging these together as a function of 
  frequency. The desired portion of the picture is specified in the size field.

  If a transform size (EXPONENT) is specified larger than the input sample 
  size, the necessary additional samples are generated by averaging the 
  available input data so to minimize sin(x)/x ringing. If it is defaulted,
  the transform size will be the largest power of 2 less than the input
  sample size.

  POWER will take the image format from the input's system label.

  The parameter TABLE is used to specify the name of the file 
  to contain the tab-delimited ASCII table of Frequency and Power values.

  If TYPE=PLOT is selected, the plot is generate as a POSTSCRIPT file.  (See 
  FILE parameter.)  The plot is also displayed on the X display unless the
  NODISP keyword is specified.  (An X display appears to be necessary even
  if NODISP is specified and no plot is displayed.)

  FILE='filename' is used to name the output plot file.  Specifying FILE 
  implies TYPE=PLOT. The default value of FILE is POWER.PLT.

  Example to plot on a X device:
  
         (..select an X display if not already done..)
         power inp=a.img 'plot
         
  Example to plot on the postscript printer:

         (..select an X display if not already done..)
         power inp=a.img 'plot FILE=P.PLT
         (..send P.PLT to a POSTSCRIPT printer using some OS command..)

  Example to request only tab-delimited ASCII file output:

 	 power inp=a.img table=pow.tbl

HISTORY
     04/29/97  ... SP  ... Made portable for UNIX.  Adapted for XRT pltting
                           package.  Changed COUNT for FILE parameter to 0:1
                           so that POWER can run without setting an X DISPLAY
                           by specifying neither 'PLOT nor FILE.  (Previously
                           the COUNT received by the program was always 1.)
     11/16/95  ... CCA ... MADE SCAL R*4
     07/18/94  ... CCA ... ADD OPTION OF NO TABLE COLUMN HEADERS
     10/20/94  ... CCA ... Corrected accumulation of amplitude
     06/14/94  ... CCA ... FIXED FMAX, DELETED HISTOGRAM PLOT

     02/22/94  ... CCA ... MAJOR CODE CLEANUP, REWORK OF LABEL HANDLING,
			   TEST FILE AND PLOTTING OF LABELS
     11/22/93  ... CCA ... ADD ASCII TABLE OUTPUT, CHECKS FOR OPEN
                           ERRORS, FIX TEST, MOD SELECTION OF PLOT

.LEVEL1

.VARIABLE INP
 input data set

.VARIABLE SIZE
Standard Vicar size field:
  (SL,SS,NL,NS)
You can enter SL,SS,NL,
and NS together as SIZE, OR
enter the SL,SS,NL, and NS
parameters separately.
.VARIABLE SL
Starting line number
.VARIABLE SS
Starting sample number
.VARIABLE NL
Number of lines
.VARIABLE NS
Number of samples

.VARIABLE EXPONENT
 transform size

.VARIABLE SCALE
 output plot amplitude scale

.VARIABLE DNSCALE
 scaling factor of input image

.VARIABLE FMAX
 highest frequency in the 
 plotted spectrum

.VARIABLE YLEN
 length of Y axis

.VARIABLE TYPE
 specification 
 of plotter output

.VARIABLE FILE
 specification of output 
 plot filename

.VARIABLE TITLE
 user specified label to both
 printer and plotter

.VARIABLE TITLEX
 user specified label of X
 axis to the plotter only

.VARIABLE TABLE
 name of file to contain
 tab-delimited plot data

.VARIABLE COLUMNS

 headers or not

.VARIABLE NODISP

 is displayed on screen

.LEVEL2

.VARIABLE INP
 string - input data set (only 1 input allowed)

.vari size
The size parameter determines the boundaries in the input
file from which POWER is to operate.  It is specified
as  (SL,SS,NL,NS), where
	SL is the starting line 
	SS is the starting sample
	NL is the number of lines to be copied
	NS is the number of samples (pixels) in each line

.VARIABLE EXPONENT
 EXPONENT=E where E is an integer between or equal to 3 and 10, specifying
 the exponent of 2 for the desired 1 - dimensional transform size. If half
 word data, E referes to the transform size in samples and not bytes.
 The default is the biggest power of 2 that is less than the number of input
 samples.

.VARIABLE SCALE
 REAL - DEFAULT=2.0
 SCALE = S where S is a real specifying the output plot amplitude scale.

.VARIABLE DNSCALE
 REAL - DEFAULT=1.0
 Specifies that the input DNs have been scaled up from the original values,
 and that the scale is to be removed to yield plots scaled to the original
 DNs.  An example would be scaling done during filtering.

.VARIABLE FMAX
 FMAX = F where F is a floating point number specifying the highest frequency
 in the spectrum (the nyquist or aliasing frequency). It is numerically equal
 to 1/2 of the reciprocal of the pixel-to-pixel spacing measured in whatever
 units are used. The length of the frequency axis on the line printer is
 2**(E-1) lines. It is printed 6 data points per inch, and the annotation 
 on the frequency axis is given by F/2**(E -1) DN every line, where F and E 
 are given by the FMAX and EXPONENT keywords, respectively. Default is F=0.5,
 corresponding to a pixel spacing of unity.  

 FMAX applies only to the plots, the output tables ignore it.

.VARIABLE YLEN
 specifies the length in inches of the Y axis.(default=7.0,max=30.)

.VARIABLE TYPE
 KEYWORD - VALID=(PLOT)
 Specifies POSTSCRIPT plotting.  If 'PLOT or FILE are specified,
 then the program needs permission to write to an X display.
 If neither 'PLOT nor FILE are specified, an X device is not required and
 no POSTSCIPT plotting is generated. (See also under NODISP parameter.)

.VARIABLE FILE
 Specifies the filename of the file to which the POSTSCRIPT plot is written.
 If FILE is specified, PLOT is unnecessary.  Defaults to POWER.PLT.

.VARIABLE TITLE
 string - this parameter is used to add labeling to both the line printer
 graph and plotter graph. The maximum number of characters in the added
 label is 52. The title will be placed at the top of all the graphs gen-
 erated. No title is provided if TITLE is defaulted.

.VARIABLE TITLEX
 string - this parameter is used to change the X - axis label in the plotter
 graph. The maximum number of characters in the string is 52. The default
 is FREQUENCY(CPS) where CPS can be interpreted as cycles per second or 
 cycles per sample.

.VARIABLE TABLE
 string - this parameter specifies that the plot data be output to a file
 in tab-delimited ASCII form.  It also specifies the name of the file to 
 contain the plot data.  The first column of data is the FREQ
 value.  A tab character separates this from the second column of data. 
 The second column contains the square root of the power spectrum.

.VARIABLE COLUMNS
 keyword - COLHDR specifies to put column headers into the ASCII table.
           NOCOLHDR specifies no headers in the table. 
 The headers are "FREQUENCY" and "RMS POWER".  
 Default is to put headers in the table.

.VARIABLE NODISP
 Keyword--Optional
 If present, no display is shown in interactive mode and output plot files
 are automatically saved.  When not present, plot is displayed and files are
 saved.
