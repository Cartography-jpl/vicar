VICAR program SKYMAP

.HELP
PURPOSE:
To combine Palomar Sky Survey images generated by program SKY into a
map projection mosaic.
To convert a catalogue of objects generated by program SKYCAT into the
coordinates for the map projection.

EXECUTION:
sky out=picture.img ra=(2,46,30.0) dec=(-30,14,0.0) fov=20. grid=0.0
skycat inp=picture.img out=catalogue.ascii
gen out=b.img nl=10 ns=10
MAP3 b.img ster_target.img NL=500 NS=500 'STEREOGR SCAL=.1 +
   LINE=250 SAMP=250 LATI=-30 LONG=50 +
  nora=0 'NOGEOM 'NOSEDR 'NOPROJEC radii=(1,1,1) +
 ommatrix=(1.,0.,0.,0.,1.,0.,0.,0.,1.) rsvector=(1.,1.,1.)
! create list of images in  picture.list
! create list of catalogues in  catalogue.list
skymap inp=(ster_target.img,picture.list,catalogue.list) +
 out=(map.img,cat.ascii) 

.PAGE
METHOD:
Skymap accepts an image label from map3 as the first input image. This image
is only used to get the label from, the image itself is ignored. This label
is used as the output map projection definition including nl and ns.

The second input is a list of file names, one per record, listing all
the sky images to be projected into the mosaic. These images will be
combined into the first output file.

The third input is an OPTIONAL list of filenames in a 1:1 ordering with
the second input list containing the corresponding catalogues of objects
located by skycat in each of the input images. The contents of these
catalogues will be combined into the second output file.

FORMAT of the output catalogue:
Each object occupies one ascii record with 13 fields (columns).

Field    Description
1     Object entry number (integer 1- n).
2     RA ( double, degrees j2000 ).
3     Dec ( double, degrees j2000 ).
4     line ( double, image line number 1-n ).
5     sample ( double, image sample number 1-n ).
6     b magnitude. double
7     v magnitude. double
8     Proper motion in RA ( double, arcseconds/year ).
9     Proper motion in Dec ( double, arcseconds/year ).
10    Object classification ( string, ie: Star,Galaxy,Radio..).
11    Morphology ( string, ie: SBbc,E,...).
12    Spectrum ( string, ie: G2,A0,...).
13    Object name (ascii string from the originating catalogue ).

Numerical fields which are empty are filled with -99.000000
Ascii fields which are empty are filled with "none"

.LEVEL1

.VARI INP
1. Desired map label.
2. Input picture 
   list of filenames.
3. optional Input catalogue 
   list of filenames.

.VARI OUT
1. Map projection.
2. optional Output catalogue.

.VARI MODE
exact: every pixel
grid: interpolate

.VARI STATUS
Directory to contain
status file.
Defaults to local.
 
.LEVEL2

.VARI INP
(required):
1. Desired map label from program MAP3.
2. Input picture list of filenames from program SKY.
3. optional Input catalogue list of filenames from program SKYCAT.

.VARI OUT
1. Map projection of the input picture.
2. optional Output catalogue with corrected image coordinates to match 
the projection.

.VARI MODE
mode=exact
Compute each pixel independently.

mode=grid
compute a grid of points 50 pixels apart and interpolate between these
points
 
.VARI STATUS
Directory to contain the status file.
Defaults to the local directory.
The status file is called "status_file.txt"
If the program was successful it will contain the string "success".
If the program began but failed to run it will contain the string "failure" on
record 1 followed by optional records containing ascii messages describing
the nature of the error.
