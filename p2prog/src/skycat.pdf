.TITLE
VICAR program SKYCAT

.HELP
PURPOSE:
To create a catalogue of objects contained within a Palomar Sky Survey image
as created by the vicar program SKY.

Skycat extracts objects from the:
1.  Hubble Space Telescope Guide Star Catalogue on the Jukebox.
2.  Simbad data base in Strasbourg.

EXECUTION:
sky out=picture.img ra=(14,22,33.854) dec=(0,-13,37.57) fov=15
skycat inp=picture.img out=catalogue.ascii password="    "

GETTING INTO SIMBAD:
The Simbad data base wants a password. You can access SIMBAD two ways:
 
1. Give the password:
skycat ...  password="   "
 
2. Let kerberos get it for you by running the following unix code before
getting into vicar:
selcat o
kinit (which will ask you for your initials and kerberos password).

.PAGE
METHOD:
Uses the mips jukebox.

FORMAT of the output catalogue:
Each object occupies one ascii record with 13 fields (columns).

Field    Description
1     Object entry number (integer 1- n).
2     RA ( double, degrees j2000 ).
3     Dec ( double, degrees j2000 ).
4     line ( double, image line number 1-n ).
5     sample ( double, image sample number 1-n ).
6     b magnitude. double
7     v magnitude. double
8     Proper motion in RA ( double, arcseconds/year ).
9     Proper motion in Dec ( double, arcseconds/year ).
10    Object classification ( string, ie: Star,Galaxy,Radio..).
11    Morphology ( string, ie: SBbc,E,...).
12    Spectrum ( string, ie: G2,A0,...).
13    Object name (ascii string from the originating catalogue ).

Numerical fields which are empty are filled with -99.000000
Ascii fields which are empty are filled with "none"

.LEVEL1

.VARI INP
Input image

.VARI OUT
Output catalogue

.VARI USERID
Simbad userid
 
.VARI PASSWORD
Simbad password

.VARI PATH
Directory path for
catalogue files

.VARI STATUS
Directory to contain
status file.
Defaults to local.
 
.LEVEL2

.VARI INP
Input image generated by program SKY.

.VARI OUT
Output ascii catalogue.

.VARI USERID
Simbad userid. 
This defaults to a valid userid unless you have your own.
 
.VARI PASSWORD
Simbad password.
See the METHOD section to permit kerberos to get it for you.

.VARI PATH
Directory path for
catalogue files
 
.VARI STATUS
Directory to contain the status file.
Defaults to the local directory.
The status file is called "status_file.txt"
If the program was successful it will contain the string "success".
If the program began but failed to run it will contain the string "failure" on
record 1 followed by optional records containing ascii messages describing
the nature of the error.
