.TITLE
 "resloc" -- Locates Voyager image reseau marks.
.HELP
 PURPOSE:

 "RESLOC" will locate the reseaux on pictures recorded by Voyager
 cameras.  It will also output those locations as a solitary file.
 of "geoma" parameters.

 EXECUTION:

   The following is the execution statement for "resloc":

	resloc INP=(PIC,[RES]) OUT=(RES,[GEOM]) PARAMS

 where PIX is an input image, RES is a reseau location file, and
 PARAMS are other user parameters.  Items in square brackets []
 are optional.   

 Further details are given in the respective parameter sections in
 TUTOR mode.
.page
 OPERATION:

 If the VGR reseau location master file is included as a secondary
 input, "RESLOC" will first check it to see if there is an entry for
 the frame PIC.  If an entry already exists, the reseau locations
 are retrieved from the VGR reseau location master file and output
 to RES.  If no entry exists, or if the keyword REDO is specified,
 then the reseau will be located on the input picture PIC, and stored
 in the VGR reseau location master file. The location of the reseau
 requires a set of nominal locations to be used as starting values.
 If the VGR reseau location master file is not present, these nominals
 are retrieved from tables built into the program. In general, it is
 desirable to use the nominals in the VGR reseau location master file
 because these will be more current and accurate. Optionally, the
 reseau master file may be replaced.
.page
 "RESLOC" will search for each reseau mark in an NHOR by NVER area centered
 about its nominal location. At present, marks near the boundaries of the
 picture are not located.  Coordinates for these marks are calculated by
 interpolating over its nearest neighbors. Each mark is found by using an
 NLW by NSW correlation window.  As this window scans over the search area,
 the underlying area is compared with a reseau shape function (constant for
 all the marks) of the form:
   	f(x,y) = 255(1 - exp(-(x**2 + y**2)/2s**2)
 For a 9 by 9 window, the shape function is:
	254 254 254 254 254 254 254 254 254 254
	254 254 254 253 252 253 254 254 254 254
	254 254 250 234 220 234 250 254 254 254
	254 253 234 161 100 161 234 253 254 254
	254 252 220 100   0 100 220 252 254 254
	254 253 234 161 100 161 234 253 254 254
	254 254 250 234 220 234 250 254 254 254
	254 254 254 253 252 253 254 254 254 254
	254 254 254 254 254 254 254 254 254 254
.page
 Let A(i,j) represent the shape function, and B(i,j) be the area of
 the picture being compared.  Let uA, uB, tA, tB be the corresponding
 means and standard deviations.  The correlation function is a normalized
 variance of the form:
     p = (SIGMA(Aij-uA)(Bij-uB))/(N*tA*tB)
 where N = NLW*NSW and the summation is performed
 over an NLW by NSW window.

 If a correlation fails to give a valid result for some point, then
 the reseau location is set to the nominal location, plus an offset
 computed as an average of the offsets of a set of nearby locations.
 In a case where a large area of the image contains invalid data, and
 therefore no correlations can be found, reseau locations will simply be
 set equal to the nominals, and a warning message is issued from
 subroutine FILLOC.
.page
 EXAMPLES:
	
	resloc INP=(A,VGR:RESFIL.TST) OUT=RES
	ressar77 INP=(A,RES) OUT=B
 "RESLOC" is used to store the reseaux in the frame stored in data set A.
 The resulting locations are input to "ressar77" to remove the marks.

	resloc INP=(A,VGR:RESFIL.TST) OUT= (RES,GEOM)
	geoma INP=(A,GEOM) OUT=C SIZE=(1,1,1000,1000)
 "RESLOC" is used to generate parameters for "geoma". "geoma" is then executed
 to geometrically correct the frame stored in data set A.  Note the
 current object space (henceforth refered to as funny space) is 1000
 by 1000.  Since funny space is not the officially approved object space,
 all pictures transformed to funny space should be properly labeled as
 such, and the result derived from such a space should be marked as being
 of dubious value. (See Gary Yagi for questions regarding funny space.)
.page
 RESTRICTIONS:
   The constants NLW, NSW, NHOR, NVER must satisfy
   the following:
     1. Each must be odd;
     2. 2*NHOR*(NVER+2) + NLW*(NSW + 4) + 800*(NLW+NVER) <= 58086
        If NLW = NSW and NHOR = NVER, then the following
        simplified formula may be used:
                NLW + NVER <= 42
.page
 TIMING:
 The execution time of "resloc" is directly proportional to the window and
 search dimensions NLW, NSW, NHOR, NVER.  For the default values,
 the program takes 1 min. 20 sec. per frame on an IBM360, and 2 min. 30 sec.
 per frame on a VAX 11/780.

For purposes of testing, a small sample master reseau location file
named RESFIL.TST is in the current MIPL test directory.  Please check
with Integration and Test to determine where this directory is located.
This file should not be randomly modified: copy it to a scratch directory 
before tampering with it.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
 One picture file generated by one of the Voyager
 logging program.  This frame should be an
 unprocessed  byte image (i.e. No stretching, filtering
 or geom allowed).  Followed by either:
   1. the Voyager reseau location master file;
   2. a solitary reseau location file of nominal reseau locations;
   3. neither.

 "resloc" checks the file type of the second input file if it 
 is present.  If a solitary nominal reseau location file
 is used in "resloc" as the second input file, this code may type a message
 'INVALID "resloc" FILE'. This error message should be ignored.
.VARIABLE OUT
 A  solitary reseau file containing the coordinates (LINE,SAMPLE)
 for each reseau mark in a format suitable for input to the programs
 "res77" and "ressar77". (RES is of size 1616 bytes by 1 line.)

 Optionally, an additional file of size 3600 bytes by 3 lines
 containing GEOMA parameters. 

 Both outputs have VICAR labels.
.VARIABLE CAMERA
 CAMERA specifies the camera serial number for the
 input picture.  This parameter may be used to
 override the camera information in the Voyager
 label.
.VARIABLE DBUG
 Causes diagnostic messages to be printed.
 (Default is no messages printed.)
.VARIABLE PRINT
 Causes a listing of the reseau locations and GEOMA
 parameters (if present) to be generated.
 (Default is that no such listing is printed.)
.VARIABLE NOIN
 The program will normally attempt to calculate
 the reseau locations to sub-pixel accuracy.  This
 keyword suppresses the interpolation routine. 
.VARIABLE NVER
 NVER is an integer specifying the height of the
 search area. (must be odd) (Default =19)
.VARIABLE NHOR
 NHOR  is an integer specifying the width of the
 search area. (must be odd) (Default = 19)
.VARIABLE NLW
 NLW is an integer specifying the height of the
 correlation area. (must be odd) (Default = 5)
.VARIABLE NSW
 NSW is an integer specifying the width of the
 correlation area. (must be odd) (Default = 5)
.VARIABLE SIGMA
 SIGMA is a real number specifying the standard
 deviation constant used in the reseau shape function.
 (Default = 1.0)
.VARIABLE FRAME
 FRAME  is an integer specifying the frame number for
 the input picture.  This parameter will override
 the frame number in the Voyager label.
.VARIABLE REDO
 REDO  specifies the location of the reseau is to
 be redone, i.e., any prior entry for the frame
 in the VGR reseau location master file will be overwritten.
.VARIABLE NOMS
 NOMS indicates that nominals are being used instead of the
 VGR master reseau location file.
.VARIABLE CTHRESH
 A THRESHOLD ON CORRELATION VALUES.
 Default is CTHRESH=0.5.
.vari DNTHRESH
 DNTHRESH is a threshold DN value that is used only in discriminating
 between correlation peaks in a search area:  if several peaks exceed
 CTHRESH, then the peak with DN < DNTHRESH is selected.

 If none of the DN values are < DNTHRESH, or if several peaks have DN
 values < DNTHRESH, then the highest correlation peak is used.
 The default for DNTHRESH is 10.
.VARIABLE FIT
 VALID = 1:8
 Default is FIT = 8 (unconstrained linear fit).
 FIT specifies the type of fit to be performed.  Meanings are :

         IFIT  ROTATE SCALE  OFFSET
          1      0      0      1
          2      0      1      0
          3      0      1      1
          4      1      0      0
