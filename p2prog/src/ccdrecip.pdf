VICAR Application Program CCDRECIP

PURPOSE:

CCDRECIP determines the shutter offset (in msec) and sensitivity
(in DN per foot-lambert-milliseconds (UNITS = LUMINANC) or
in DN per picoamp-milliseconds (UNITS = RADIANCE)) for a
camera system.  The program is one of a series of programs originally
developed to support radiometric calibration of the Galileo SSI camera system.
(UNITS should be LUMINANC for Galileo and RADIANCE for Cassini).

Vicar Plotting

The Vicar Plotting system can produce plots on a display device if required.
The plotting system always generates a postscript file suitable for plotting on 
either a hard copy device or a display device. The postscript file can be 
defaulted to a system derived name or can be explicitly named by the user.  

The user can run plotting programs either interactively or in batch.  Whether 
or not plots are required, a plotting device (node) must be specified. This may
or may not be the plotting device the user requires.  To override the system 
defaulted device, the user must select a display device.  This is implemented 
from an Alpha using the following following:
           set display/create/trans=tcpip/node=poconos.  
This allocates a UNIX workstation named "poconos". If the user is on an Alpha
and wishes to plot to a UNIX workstation, the user first type: 
           xhost coda2 
where coda2 is the name of the Alpha from which plots will be sent.  
.PAGE
To plot on a UNIX workstation, the user needs to type on the UNIX workstation
           setenv DISPLAY poconos:0.0
which allocates the UNIX workstation named "poconos".      
Note: poconos and coda2 are examples of nodes.  The user may send and direct 
plots from and to any node he chooses.  

Interactively, either on the command line or in a pdf, the user may decide 
decide whether or not to plot the graphics.   If the user requires only a hard
copy, he must add 'nodisp to the program command line.   This will inhibit the 
plotting of the graphics on a display device.  

In batch, the user may not request plots on a display device.  Only postscript
files will be produced.  In order to generate postscript files in batch mode , 
the user MUST allocate a display device from WITHIN the batch script.  If the 
user fails to do this, no postscript files will be produced.

EXECUTION:
                CCDRECIP INP=RCP.DAT OUT=MARK.DAT PARAMS

The input is a Reciprocity File (RCP) containing statistical data for
specified areas in the image for each exposure of a reciprocity sequence.
The RCP must have been previously initialized via LTGEN and loaded with
data via MOMGEN.

The output is an optional MARK-format tiepoint data set containing the
centers of all areas rejected for producing values for SENSITIVITY or
SHUTTER OFFSET or either which differ by more than 2 sigma from the mean
values for all the areas.

.PAGE
MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND:

The output camera signal is proportional to exposure as follows:

      DN-DC = A*L*(T-To)
where
      DN-DC is the output signal minus the dark current,
      A is the camera sensitivity (DN/foot-lambert-milliseconds (LUMINANC)) or
                                   DN/picoamp-milliseconds (RADIANCE))
      L is the light cannon setting (foot-lamberts (LUMINANC)) or
        is the spectral radiance of the source (picoamp (RADIANCE)),
      T is the commanded exposure time (milliseconds), and
      To is the shutter-offset (milliseconds).

CCDRECIP solves for the sensitivity A and shutter-offset To, given data
points DN acquired by varying the light cannon setting (or spectral radiance of
the source) and exposure time:
         i
                DN - DC = A*L *(T -To)
                  i          i   i

.PAGE
OPERATION:

CCDRECIP performs the following steps:

  1) Read data from the Reciprocity File.
  2) Compute the sensitivity and shutter offset for each area.
  3) Compute mean values for sensitivity and shutter-offset (by averaging
     the values extracted from each area) and flag all areas deviating
     by more than 1 or 2 sigma from the mean.
  4) Re-compute the mean value for sensitivity and shutter-offset,
     ignoring all flagged values as specified by the REJECT parameter.

If the REJECT parameter is specified (default=2), areas may be rejected
because of a bad value for sensitivity (REJECT=1), shutter-offset (REJECT=2),
or either (REJECT=3).  If REJECT=0, no area rejection is performed.

CCDRECIP prints out the following:

  1) Sensitivity and shutter-offset for each area.
  2) Summary of all areas with bad values for sensitivity or shutter-offset.
  3) Mean sensitivity as a function of exposure time.
  4) Global value for sensitivity and shutter-offset, obtained by combining
     data from all good areas.
  5) Shutter-offset as a function of image line or sample number.

Note that the sensitivity and offset are listed as AO and TOS in the printout.

If the PLOT keyword is specified, CCDRECIP produces the following plots:

  1) (DN-DC)/L vs SHUTTER TIME
  2) (DN-DC)/(L*T) vs SHUTTER TIME
  3) (DN-DC)/[L*(T-To)] vs SHUTTER TIME
  4) To vs image line or sample number.  The raw points are plotted with
     "+" and the average shutter offset at a given line or sample number
     is plotted as a solid line.

The resulting plot file should be printed out using the NOFEED qualifier
(see example below).

Four types of tabular output data are also available.  The AREATBL
parameter produces a tab-delimitted ASCII text file containing:
if UNITS = LUMINANC, MEAN_DN(D), LUM(L), EXP(T), L*T, ACTUAL(T-To), D/L,
D/L*T, and D/L*(T-To), and if UNITS = RADIANCE, MEAN_DN(D), RAD(L), EXP(T),
L*T, ACTUAL(T-To), D/L, D/L*T, and D/L*(T-To), for each exposure level.

The OFFTBL parameter produces a tab-delimitted ASCII text file containing:
LINE or SAMPLE and calculated SHUTTER_OFFSET for all good areas.

The AVOFFTBL parameter produces a tab-delimitted ASCII text file containing:
LINE or SAMPLE and mean SHUTTER_OFFSET for each row or column of grid areas.

The CORRTBL parameters produces two files tabulating the correction
achieved as a result of using the derived shutter-offset.  The first
of the two files holds the uncorrected sensitivity values averaged over
each column or row (see DIRECTIO parameter) of grid points.  The second
file holds the corrected values.  If DIRECTIO is LINE, then the values
of the grid rows are averaged.  If SAMP, then the values of the grid
columns are averaged.

If an output file is specified, the centers of all flagged areas (as
specified by the REJECT parameter) are stored in a MARK-format tiepoint
data set.  These areas can be subsequently displayed (see example below)
to indicate the spatial distribution of regions which give rise to bad
sensitivity or shutter-offset constants.

If an output shutter-offset file is specified via the OFFSET parameter,
then a file containing shutter offsets for each image line or sample is
generated.  These offsets are calculated by using the average shutter-offsets
as found above and then performing a piece-wise linear interpolation for the
lines or samples that fall between data points.  A linear extrapolation is
done at each end using the first and last two points.  These shutter-offsets
can later be used as inputs to GALGEN, see GALGEN's TUTOR and HELP files.

Instead of entering the light values of the exposure levels as a
multivalued parameter, they can be contained in an ASCII file.  This file
merely contains one light value per record (see procedure MOMGEN2 for
the format details).  The file is specified to CCDRECIP using the LTFILE
parameter.

NOTE:  The first value in the LIGHT parameter set or the LTFILE
       file should be 0.0 to correspond with EXPO=0.0 for the dark
       current frames.

The parameter DIRECTIO is used to tell CCDRECIP to derive a Line- or a
Sample-dependent shutter-offset.

Because CCDRECIP is dealing with the Light Transfer File and not the raw
images, it doesn't know how big they are.  Therefore, the user must tell
CCDRECIP how many elements the shutter-offset should contain.  This is
done with the ARRAYSIZ parameter.

NOTE:  CCDRECIP CANNOT be used with reciprocity sequences that contain
       extended dark current or extended exposure frames.
