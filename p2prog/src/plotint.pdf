PURPOSE

     PLOTINT plots data contained in columns of an IBIS interface file
	using the device independent Calcomp plotting system.
	Either lines or symbols may be plotted, and the graph can 
	be fully annotated with titles, etc.

Vicar Plotting

The Vicar Plotting system can produce plots on a display device if required.
The plotting system always generates a postscript file suitable for plotting on 
either a hard copy device or a display device. The postscript file can be 
defaulted to a system derived name or can be explicitly named by the user.  

The user can run plotting programs either interactively or in batch.  Whether 
or not plots are required, a plotting device (node) must be specified. This may
or may not be the plotting device the user requires.  To override the system 
defaulted device, the user must select a display device.  This is implemented 
from an Alpha using the following following:
           set display/create/trans=tcpip/node=poconos.  
This allocates a UNIX workstation named "poconos". If the user is on an Alpha
and wishes to plot to a UNIX workstation, the user first type: 
           xhost coda2 
where coda2 is the name of the Alpha from which plots will be sent.  
.PAGE
To plot on a UNIX workstation, the user needs to type on the UNIX workstation
           setenv DISPLAY poconos:0.0
which allocates the UNIX workstation named "poconos".      
Note: poconos and coda2 are examples of nodes.  The user may send and direct 
plots from and to any node he chooses.  

Interactively, either on the command line or in a pdf, the user may decide 
decide whether or not to plot the graphics.   If the user requires only a hard
copy, he must add 'nodisp to the program command line.   This will inhibit the 
plotting of the graphics on a display device.  

In batch, the user may not request plots on a display device.  Only postscript
files will be produced.  In order to generate postscript files in batch mode , 
the user MUST allocate a display device from WITHIN the batch script.  If the 
user fails to do this, no postscript files will be produced.

    INP specifies the input interface file that contains the data to be 
plotted.  The column number of independent data is XCOL and the column(s)
of dependent data are in YCOL.  The control column (CONTROL) must have the
same entry for all of the rows that are to be on one plot.  The axis lengths
XLEN and YLEN are in inches.  The SYMTYPE parameter specifies what type of
plotting is done for each dependent variable:  0 for symbols only, 1 for
lines only, and 2 for both symbols and lines.  Only every FREQ'th data point
is plotted; default is to plot each one.  If the ranges are defaulted then
a Calcomp automatic scaling is done. The DEVICE parameter indicates the 
output device (as per PLOTTING).  The default is for PRINTRONIX/ReGIS/IMAGE/TEK.
When multiple plots are desired on the CALCOMP, this switch must be set.  All
of the plots are then plotted on one sheet of paper approx. 4.5" apart.

     or 'KEYWORD
                         CALCOMP --Calcomp plotter
                         REGIS   --REGIS plotting package
                         IMAGE   --IMAGE plotting device

                         For CALCOMP/IMAGE this variable must be set.  It
                         will produce one plot file with all of the plots 
                         contained therein.  Output is then on one piece 
                         of paper for the CALCOMP.  Multiple plots do work
                         on the IMAGE device, but there is no screen pause
                         between  plots.  For the other devices
                         default is acceptable.  One plot file is produced
                         for each plot.  
                         
.vari plotout
The name of the output postscript file if NODISP specified.

Note that this file will always be created, but it will be empty unless
NODISP is specified.
