.TITLE
VICAR/IBIS Program "omcor2"

.HELP
PURPOSE
This program updates the first input IBIS SEDR file by changing 
the OM Euler angles in columns 21,22,23 which define camera
pointing via the OM matrix. "omcor2" performs a global function
minimization of tiepoint residuals by determining the OM
matrices which cause the tiepoints to disagree between image
pairs by a minimum.
 
The GLL flight projects permit very little error in north angle. We suggest
that you use the 'FIT2 parameter to reflect this. Your solutions will improve.

"omcor2" differs from omcor in two ways:
1. Control images are not permitted to move (their OM matrices
   are considered known).
2. "omcor2" permits the use of a zonal velocity flow model to shift
   tiepoints to the common time of the ground control image.
   This permits a global solution for the navigation for non solid
   objects like jupiter. See the ZONAL keyword.
3. The FIT2 keyword permits the north angle to remain fixed for all images.

EXECUTION
omcor2 inp=(SEDR.INT,TIEPOINTS.INT,GEOM.COR)
or-
omcor2 inp=(SEDR.INT,TIEPOINTS.INT)

EXAMPLE: (Galileo)
See mosaicking procedure MANUAL4 in MANMATCH.PDF (Help file).

omcor2 inp=(jupsedr.int,jupmatch.int) +
    'zonal project=GLL camera=1 'fit2

PRECISION
The differences between the unported and ported VAX test logs and the 
differences between the VAX and UNIX test logs are due to the image
space mode being invoked with object space data.  The discrepency is
probably due to two factors:
1. There is no clear solution (bogus test case) so the solution is 
probably very sensitive to precision.
2. Many transformations are made from image to object space resulting in
small errors which get fed into the minimization scheme.

HISTORY
27 AUG 96  ARV  (CIT)  Added FIT2 capability
10 JUL 95  AMS  (CRI)  Made portable for UNIX

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
First input= SEDR.INT produced
 by program "ibisnav"
Second input=TIEPOINTS.INT
 by program "manmatch"
Third input=
A "geoma" distortion file.

.VARIABLE PROJECT
Specifies  the 
project. 

.VARIABLE OBJECT
Causes images to be 
considered geometrically
corrected.

.VARIABLE FIT2
Causes kappa (north angle)
to be kept fixed.

.VARIABLE CAMERA
The camera serial number.

.VARIABLE GROUND
Ground control frames

.VARIABLE TOLERANC
fractional convergence
tolerance.

.VARIABLE OLD
Source of Euler
angles in SEDR.

.VARIABLE ZONAL
Use zonal flow.

.VARIABLE ZVP
Name of zonal
flow file.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
First input= SEDR.INT produced by program "ibisnav"
On output columns 21-23 are recomputed to reflect the updated 
OM matrix angles. Columns 21-23 will NOT be changed for
ground control frames.
NOTE: Place those frames which will become ground control frames
at the END of the SEDR.INT file. See GROUND parameter.
There can be up to 100 sedr file entries (frames).
Note: The scet columns 32-37 must be filled for zonal correction.
This can be assured by using a FILENAME file in "ibisnav".


Second input= TIEPOINTS.INT produced by program "manmatch".
This has 9 columns.
There can be up to 768 tiepoints.

A geom correction file can be entered as the third input
if the images are in image space (un geometrically corrected).
If the project is not GLL and no geom file is present then
nominals will be generated using the PROJECT and CAMERA
parameters.
Not necessary if project is GLL.

.VARIABLE PROJECT
Specifies the project . 
Valid values are: VGR-1 VGR-2 GLL MAR-9 MAR10 VIKOR
Required.

.VARIABLE OBJECT
Causes images to be considered geometrically corrected.
The geoma file will be ignored if present.

.VARIABLE FIT2
Fits two of the three angles, keeping kappa (north angle)
fixed at the input value.

.VARIABLE CAMERA
The camera serial number. Only used in 'IMAGE mode.
Defaults to the entry in the 4th ibis column of the sedr ibis file.
Only one camera is permitted per execution of omcor2.

Voyager:
Used to assist in reading the GEOM parameters for geometric correction.

Galileo:
Used to determine the correct image space correction 
depending upon if an image is summation mode or not.
Normal images must have CAMERA=1.
Summation mode images must have CAMERA=2.

.VARIABLE GROUND
Ground control frames. The number given defines those
images in the SEDR input file which are defined
as ground control frames. 
GROUND specifies the first ground control frame.
All frames after GROUND will ALSO be considered to be
ground control frames.
It is assumed that the
navigation contained in the first input ibis file is
rigorously correct for these frames and will not be altered.
Numbering begins at 1 for the first input, 2 for the
second input and so on. 
If you default GROUND the last frame (last SEDR record) will
become the ground control.
Note: If ZONAL is specified then GROUND is ignored and defaults to
      the last frame.

.VARIABLE TOLERANC
fractional convergence tolerance.
Controls the precision and iteration length of the function
minimization scheme. Is defined as the ratio:
2*(max_error - min_error)/(max_error + min_error)
Cannot be less than the machine real*8 precision.
Defaults to 1.0e-6

.VARIABLE OLD
Source of Euler angles in input SEDR.INT file.
If you specify 'OLD then the euler angles will come from 
columns 8,9,10. The default is they come from columns 21,22,23.
Columns 21,22,23 are initially copies of columns 8,9,10 but are updated
in-place with the program solutions.

.VARIABLE ZONAL
Use the zonal flow profile to shift each tiepoint by the amount of
differential rotation suffered over the interval between when that
image was obtained and when the ground control frame was obtained.
Only use for non solid planets like Jupiter. The images must be
obtained over a small time difference ( minutes not hours ) or else
the zonal drift will introduce large errors.

.VARIABLE ZVP
Name of the zonal flow file.
Defaults to jupiter.zvp
