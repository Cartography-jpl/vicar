.TITLE
Create noise in images.

.HELP
PURPOSE:

Addnoise creates three types of noise:
1. Additive gaussian noise.
2. Shot noise (multiplicative ccd type noise).
3. Bit error noise.

EXECUTION:

addnoise inp=a out=b sigma=10.            Additive gaussian noise 
addnoise inp=a out=b gain=30.             ccd shot noise
addnoise inp=a out=b rate=100 bits=8      bit error noise

The SEED parameter is provided so the same random patterns can be generated.
If it is defaulted the seed for the random number generator comes from the
system time.

Note, more than one noise can be simulated at one time. If you specify "sigma"
and "gain" and "rate" for example, you'll get all three. The ordering of
these is:
first  shot noise
second additive noise
third  bit noise

METHOD:

Additive noise:
dn_out= dn_in + sigma

Shot noise:
dn_out = sqrt(1/gain) * sqrt(dn_in) * x + dn_in
where x is a random gaussian distribution with a mean deviation of 1.0

Bit error noise:
A pixel rate is computed from the bit rate.
A random number selects the pixels to hit.
Another random number selects the bit to flip.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE IN
Input image 
.VARIABLE OUT
Output image
.VARIABLE SIGMA
The standard deviation
of the distribution
for additive noise.
.VARIABLE GAIN
Ccd gain constant
in electrons/dn.
.VARIABLE RATE
Bit error rate.
.VARIABLE BITS
Bits per pixel.
.VARIABLE SEED
The starting seed for the
random number generator

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE IN
Input image
 
.VARIABLE OUT
Output image

.VARIABLE SIGMA
Triggers additive noise to be created.
The standard deviation of the distribution for additive noise.

.VARIABLE GAIN
Triggers shot noise to be created.
Ccd gain constant in electrons/dn.
Typical values for galileo were gain=30 in gain state 4 and gain=170 in
gain state 2.

.VARIABLE RATE
Triggers bit error noise to be created.
For example a bit error rate of 100 means one bit in 100 is hit on the average.

Note, the algorithm does not permit a pixel to be hit more than once.
Note, see the BITS keyword.

.VARIABLE BITS
Bits per pixel. Defaults to 8. Only used in the bit error "RATE" mode.
This is the lower number of bits which can be changed per word. 

Note: bits does not default to the format type. If you have HALF data but
only 12 bits/pixel in a 16 bit field you must set bits=12 not to 16.
Avoid changing the sign bit by setting bits to one less than the word length.

.VARIABLE SEED
The starting seed for the random number generator. Defaults to time of day.
