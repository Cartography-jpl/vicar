REGISTER

.help
PURPOSE:
To autonomously register N images by translation only.
Register performs a sigle correlation in the center of the image. The
correlation is about 50 by 50 over a widow about 100 by 100. Your images
must be pre registered to within 25 pixels.

EXECUTION STATEMENT:
register inp=(x1,x2,...xn) out=(y2,...,yn)
where:
x1-xn are n input images
y2-yn are n-1 output images corresponding to x2-xn.

NOTE: An ascii file will be generated called "register.table" which contains
the line and sample shifts of all the images. The file has 2 columns:
line_shift sample_shift.

METHOD:
Register selects a large region near the picture center and correlates a
single tiepoint for each input image relative to the first input.
The first image is used as the reference and is not copied to the output.

  The Gruen correlation scheme used here permits distortions between 
correlation areas of the form:
newline=line*A+sample*B+C
newsamp=line*D+sample*E+F
The task of the correlator is to determine the coefficients A-F which permit 
the best correlation value.

Poor correlations cause the images to be copied.

PROGRAM HISTORY

Cognizant programmer: Jean Lorre
Revisions: New

.LEVEL1
.VARI INP
N input images.

.VARI OUT
N-1 output images.

.VARI ONELABEL
Copy first label
to all outputs

.VARI QUALITY
Min permitted correlation
quality. > 0 & < 1.

.VARI SDEV
Minimum permitted
image standard deviation.

.VARI FILLIN
To fill in the zero
border caused by
registration.

.VARI AREA
Override of the location and search areas for correlation.
AREA=(line,sample,nlarea,nsarea,nlw,nsw) where:
line=line location of center of correlation area.
sample=sample location of center of correlation area.
nlarea=number of lines of search window.
nsarea=number of samples of search window.
nlw=correlation size in lines.
nsw=correlation size in samples.

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
N input images.
The first is the reference.

.VARI OUT
N-1 output images.
The same order as the input images except input number 1 is not repeated.
Output images are optional.

.VARI ONELABEL
Copy the first label to all outputs.
The default is for each output image to keep it's original input label.

.VARI QUALITY
Min permitted correlation quality. > 0 & < 1.
Images with a correlation quality below this are passed through without 
registration.

.VARI SDEV
Minimum permitted image standard deviation.
Images with a standard deviation below this are passed through without 
registration.

.VARI FILLIN
To fill in the zero border caused by registration.
NOFILLIN or FILLIN.
