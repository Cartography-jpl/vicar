VICAR/IBIS Program "plot3d"
.HELP
PURPOSE

    "plot3d" plots 3-D IBIS graphics-1 files in true 2-D perspective on 
the plotting devices.  The plot may be automatically or manually scaled.
The perspective may be from any angle or distance.  The plot may be 
annotated in a variety of ways.  Optionally, the perspective transformation
may be performed and data output in an IBIS 2-D graphics file.

Vicar Plotting

The Vicar Plotting system can produce plots on a display device if required.
The plotting system always generates a postscript file suitable for plotting on 
either a hard copy device or a display device. The postscript file can be 
defaulted to a system derived name or can be explicitly named by the user.  

The user can run plotting programs either interactively or in batch.  Whether 
or not plots are required, a plotting device (node) must be specified. This may
or may not be the plotting device the user requires.  To override the system 
defaulted device, the user must select a display device.  This is implemented 
from an Alpha using the following following:
           set display/create/trans=tcpip/node=poconos.  
This allocates a UNIX workstation named "poconos". If the user is on an Alpha
and wishes to plot to a UNIX workstation, the user first type: 
           xhost coda2 
where coda2 is the name of the Alpha from which plots will be sent.  
.PAGE
To plot on a UNIX workstation, the user needs to type on the UNIX workstation
           setenv DISPLAY poconos:0.0
which allocates the UNIX workstation named "poconos".      
Note: poconos and coda2 are examples of nodes.  The user may send and direct 
plots from and to any node he chooses.  

Interactively, either on the command line or in a pdf, the user may decide 
decide whether or not to plot the graphics.   If the user requires only a hard
copy, he must add 'nodisp to the program command line.   This will inhibit the 
plotting of the graphics on a display device.  

In batch, the user may not request plots on a display device.  Only postscript
files will be produced.  In order to generate postscript files in batch mode , 
the user MUST allocate a display device from WITHIN the batch script.  If the 
user fails to do this, no postscript files will be produced.

EXECUTION

Examples:

A standard autoscaling 3-D plot:
plot3d  THREE.GRA  PLOTSIZE=6.0 ELEV=30 AZIMUTH=135 DISTANCE=200 

To plot a file in (line,sample,Z) format and scale the Z value down:
plot3d  THREE.GRA  DATAFORM=LSZ PLOTSIZE=3 ZSCALE=100

To plot a 3-D axis and title:
plot3d  THREE.GRA  PLOTSIZE=6.0 ELEV=30 AZIMUTH=135  AXIS=10 +
			'NOBOX TITLE='THREE D PLOT'

For manual scaling:
plot3d  THREE.GRA  SCALE=10 PLOTOFFS=(4.5,6)

For 2-D file output:
plot3d  THREE.GRA  TWO.GRA  ZSCALE=10  ORIGIN=(100,100,10)

For the default plot:
plot3d  THREE.GRA  


Since the device independent Calcomp plotting routines are used, the
plotting device must first be allocated with PLOTTING before running
this program.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
IBIS 3-D graphics file name.
.VARIABLE OUT
Optional 2-D IBIS graphics file.
No plot produced if output file.
.VARIABLE ELEV
Observer elevation angle
in degrees above horizon.
.VARIABLE AZIMUTH
Observer azimuthial angle
in degrees east of north.
.VARIABLE DISTANCE
Observer distance from origin
(in same units as graphics).
.VARIABLE ORIGIN   
The view origin (observer looks
toward origin) in same format
as 3-D graphics file.
.VARIABLE PLOTSIZE 
The plot size in inches.
.VARIABLE ZSCALE
Divisor to convert scale of
Z values into X,Y units.
.VARIABLE SCALE
Specify for manual scaling.
Divisor to convert graphics
file units to inches on plot.
.VARIABLE PLOTOFFS
Only used for manual scaling.
Offset of view origin (X,Y) 
from plot origin (in inches).
.VARIABLE DATAFORM 
3-D data format:
XYZ for (X,Y,Z)
YXZ for (Y,X,Z)
LSZ for (line,sample,Z)
.VARIABLE TITLE    
Title for top of plot.
.VARIABLE AXIS
3-D axis plotted if specified.
Length of axis in units of
graphics file.
.VARIABLE PARMPLOT
Keyword to plot parameter
values at bottom of plot.
.VARIABLE BOXPLOT  
Keyword to plot box
around plotted data.
.VARIABLE PEN
Number of plotting pen to use.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
IBIS 3-D graphics file name.
.VARIABLE OUT
If an output file is specified then a perspective transformation will be
performed and the result output in an 2-D IBIS graphics file.  The output
is in (X,Y) format.  No plot will be produced an output file is specified.  
The ORIGIN and ZSCALE parameters are used in the transformation, but the 
plotting scaling is not.  Thus the output will be in the same units as 
the input 3-D file.
.VARIABLE ELEV
The elevation angle of the observer in degrees above the horizon.
.VARIABLE AZIMUTH
The azimuthial angle of the observer in degrees east of north where 
north is the y direction.  Default is to look from the south (180 degrees).
.VARIABLE DISTANCE
The distance of the observer from origin (in same units as graphics file).  
This controls the amount of perspective but not the size of the plot.
.VARIABLE ORIGIN   
The 3-D location of the origin toward which the observer looks.  
In same format as the 3-D graphics file (e.g. XYZ, LSZ).
.VARIABLE PLOTSIZE 
The maximum size of the plotted data not including the plot annotation.
.VARIABLE ZSCALE
Divisor scale factor to convert scale of Z values same scale as the 
X and Y values.
.VARIABLE SCALE
If specified then the autoscaling is disabled.  
SCALE is a divisor scale factor to convert graphics file units to 
inches on plot.
.VARIABLE PLOTOFFS
Only used for manual scaling.  Offset of view origin (X,Y) from plot 
origin (in inches).
.VARIABLE DATAFORM 
The 3-D graphics-1 file contains triplets of real numbers.  
The DATAFORM parameter specifies the format of the triplet:  
XYZ for (X,Y,Z),  YXZ for (Y,X,Z),  LSZ for (line,sample,Z).
.VARIABLE TITLE    
String for centered title at top of plot.
.VARIABLE AXIS
If the AXIS parameter is specified then the 3-D axis will be plotted.
The 3-D axis consists of three lines starting at the view origin, and
drawn along the coordinate axis, with a length given by the AXIS value
in units of graphics file.
.VARIABLE PARMPLOT
Keyword to plot parameter values at bottom of plot.  The value of the
ELEV and AZIMUTH parameters, and the AXIS if specified, are plotted.
.VARIABLE BOXPLOT  
Keyword to plot a box around the plotted data.
.VARIABLE PEN
Number of plotting pen to use.
