VICAR Program "tae_path"
.HELP
PURPOSE

   This script lets the search path for the TAE vicar program to be
set by the environment variable TAE_PATH. This is a normal unix path,
with directories separated by ":". Like normal, the paths are set to
search in left to right order.

   This is not normally called directly, but rather used by the 
slogon.pdf program.
