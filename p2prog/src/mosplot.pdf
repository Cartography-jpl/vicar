VICAR/IBIS Program MOSPLOT

.HELP
PURPOSE:
  MOSPLOT is a program which performs three functions to assist
  the user in the generation of a mosaic. These functions are:
1. To plot the footprints of all the frames in a mosaic.
2. To create an overlap file which contains all of the 
   overlapping frame pairs in the mosaic.
   This file is needed by MANMATCH to acquire tiepoints.
3. To plot the residuals of tiepoints before or after the
   global SEDR has been corrected using program OMCOR.
   Also to plot ground control points.

.page

   A graphic image is displayed automatically.  To suppress the automatic
   graphics image display, the keyword 'NODISP must appear on the VICAR
   command line. When the 'NODISP keyword is included in the VICAR command
   line, the output graphics image is automatically output in PostScript
   format to a file specified by PLOTOUT. If an output PostScript filename
   is not specified via PLOTOUT, the filename will default to 'MOSPLOT.PSF'.
   To print the PostScript file; enter 'qpr mosplot.psf' on the system
   command line.

EXECUTION

To produce a footprint plot showing entire planet:
Image space:
      MOSPLOT INP=(SEDR.INT,GEOM.IMG) 
Object space:
      MOSPLOT INP=SEDR.INT 'OBJECT 

To produce a footprint plot showing only area of interest:
(Oblique stereographic projection )
Image space:
      MOSPLOT INP=(SEDR.INT,GEOM.IMG) LATLON=(45.2,167.0)
Object space:
      MOSPLOT INP=SEDR.INT 'OBJECT LATLON=(45.2,167.0)

To generate an overlap file:
Image space:
      MOSPLOT INP=(SEDR.INT,GEOM.IMG) OUT=OVER.INT 
Object space:
      MOSPLOT INP=SEDR.INT OUT=OVER.INT 'OBJECT 
NOTE: You may prefer to use the Stereographic projection mode
to create the overlap file because it does not suffer from
ambiguities when the poles or the prime meridian is contained
within the mosaic. ie:
      MOSPLOT INP=(SEDR.INT,GEOM.IMG) OUT=OVER.INT LATLON=(45.2,167.0) 

To produce a tiepoint residuals plot:
Image space:
      MOSPLOT INP=(SEDR.INT,MATCH.INT,GEOM.IMG) 
Object space:
      MOSPLOT INP=(SEDR.INT,MATCH.INT) 'OBJECT

To produce a residuals plot including ground control:
Image space:
      MOSPLOT INP=(SEDR.INT,MATCH.INT,GROUND.INT,GEOM.IMG) 
Object space:
      MOSPLOT INP=(SEDR.INT,MATCH.INT,GROUND.INT) 'OBJECT

Note: All the files are IBIS tabular files.

EXAMPLE: 
  The following example creates an updated SEDR which can then 
be used by MAP2 to create an accurate mosaic. The mosaic 
consists of 4 Ganymede frames from voyager.

.PAGE
ON THE PLOT FORMATS:
  The footprint plots are closed polygons from points
taken around the border of each frame. A number is printed
at the line=1, sample=1 corner of each frame. This is the
frame number, numbered from 1 to n in the same order of
the FDS times input to VGRIBIS.
  If the user specifies the LATLON keyword then the plot will
be an oblique stereographic projection. If LATLON is not
specified then the plot will show the entire planet.
The line and samples in the stereographic projection are
arbitrarily based upon a scale of one degree/pixel.
The stereographic projection does not suffer from problems
if the poles or prime meridian is in the mosaic.
  The residuals plots are superimposed on the footprint plots.
They represent tiepoint vectors drawn from the left image lat,lon
to the right image lat,lon and are exaggerated by EXAG in
the direction of the right image point. By left & right I mean
the order of the frames input to MANMATCH in pairs.
A CIRCLE symbol is printed at the base of each vector
along with the number of the point.
(left image position).
  If ground control file is present then the ground control
points are added to the above as vectors starting at the
computed lat,lon and extending to the given lat,lon.
They are also exaggerated. A TRIANGLE symbol is placed at the
base of each vector (computed lat,lon position)
along with the number of the point.

.PAGE
FILE STRUCTURE:
  The files are IBIS format tabular files. They consist
of 512 byte records where each column of data is written as
sequential records until exhausted. The next column begins at the
start of the next record etc. Record #1 contains the number of points
per column. All data is real*4 binary.
