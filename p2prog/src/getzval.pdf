PURPOSE

     getzval looks up brightness values in an image at a set 
     of  points  specified in an IBIS interface  file.   The 
     brightness   average   of  a  surrounding   window   is 
     calculated  for each point and placed back in the  IBIS 
     interface   file.    Interpolation  is  performed   for 
     fractional point locations.

     getzval INP=(PIC,INT) SIZE PARAMS

     where

     PIC                 is an image.
     INT                 is    an   IBIS   interface    file 
                         containing columns which give point 
                         locations in the image PIC.
                         No  output  file is  used  but  the 
                         second input file is modified.
     SIZE                is the standard VICAR size field.
     PARAMS              is  the  standard  VICAR  parameter 
                         field.

OPERATION
     The  point  locations in the IBIS file are in  floating 
     point, hence they may be fractional.  The grey value is 
     calculated for a WxW interpolated grid about the  point 
     location.  Bilinear interpolation is used.  The average 
     grey  value  is  stored in the selected column  of  the 
     interface file.   In two cases,  the flag -999.0  is 
     stored:   first,  if the window touches the boundary of 
     the  image,  or  second,  if the  REJECT  threshold  is 
     achieved in the window.   Point locations of (0,0) are
     skipped over.

.VARIABLE INP
     INP=(PIC,INT)       PIC is an image.
                         INT   is  an  IBIS  interface  file 
                         containing columns which give point 
                         locations in the image PIC.
                         No  output  file is  used  but  the 
                         second input file is modified.
.VARIABLE GET
     COLS=(L,S,T)   The   integers  L,S  specify  the   file 
                    columns   which  contain  the  line  and 
                    sample  coordinates  to  be  looked  up.  
                    Column T is used to store the  resultant 
                    grey values.
.VARIABLE REJECT
     REJECT=N       The  integer  N specifies that if  N  or 
                    more  grey  values  in a  rectangle  are 
                    zero,  then a "no information" marker is 
                    stored  instead of a  grey  value.   The 
                    marker  is  the value -999.0 .
.VARIABLE WINDOW
     WINDOW=W       specifies that a window of size W points 
                    square  is  used to obtain  the  average 
                    brightness  value.   The window will  be 
                    centered on the line,  sample coordinate 
                    even  if  it  is fractional.   W  is  an 
                    integer (default value 10).
.VARIABLE INCREM
     INCREM=(H,V)   The  floating numbers H and V specify  a 
                    horizontal  and vertical  increment  for 
                    the   WxW  window.    Thus  W=10  H=V=2. 
                    specifies  that a 20 pixel by  20  pixel 
                    area will be sampled by a 10x10 grid.
.VARIABLE NOIN
     NOIN           specifies no-interpolation option.   The 
                    DN-value  at the location nearest to the 
                    one  specified by line-sample  from  the 
                    columns L, S  will be read and stored in 
                    the column T.
