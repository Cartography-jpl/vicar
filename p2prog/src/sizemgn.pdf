VICAR program SIZEMGN
.HELP
PURPOSE:
SIZEMGN is a VICAR applications program which may be used to magnify or compress
the size of an image and/or change its aspect ratio.  This program is largely
identical to program SIZE, but contains special features to support Magellan
(MGN) processing not present in the latter program.  Additionally, unlike SIZE,
it does not support multi-band (3-dimensional) image files.

EXECUTION STATEMENT:

      SIZEMGN  INP=IPIC  OUT=OPIC  user-parameters...

where IPIC is the input image and OPIC is the output image.  IPIC and OPIC
may be in byte, halfword (16-bit integer), fullword (32-bit integer), or
floating point (REAL*4) data format.

OPIC will normally have the same data format as IPIC.  Use the OFORM parameter
to change the output format.

SIZEMGN performs  bilinear interpolation to magnify or compress the image.
The 'NOIN keyword may be used to suppress interpolation.  See sections on image
magnification and reduction below.

.page
OPERATION:

The size of the output image is specified in one of two ways:

(1) Explicitly specifying it with the NL and NS parameters:

        SIZEMGN  INP  OUT  NL=500  NS=500
    or  SIZEMGN  INP  OUT  SIZE=(1,1,500,500)

(2) Specifying a magnification or compression (zoom) factor:

        SIZEMGN  INP  OUT  ZOOM=3		! 3x magnification
        SIZEMGN  INP  OUT  ZOOM=-2         ! 2x compression
    or  SIZEMGN  INP  OUT  ZOOM=0.5        ! 2x compression

The ZOOM factor can be a floating point value.
A negative ZOOM results in image compression.  I.e. ZOOM= -2.5 is the
same as ZOOM=0.4

Note the if both NL,NS ans ZOOM are specified, the ZOOM parameter will
determine the magnification/compression factor and NL,NS will determine the
size of the output image.

Independent zooms may be specified in the line (vertical) and sample
(horizontal) directions:

        SIZEMGN  INP  OUT  LZOOM=2  SZOOM=3
        SIZEMGN  INP  OUT  LZOOM=3  SZOOM=-2

As the last example implies, the image may be magnified in one direction
and compressed in the other.

The AREA parameter may be used to restrict processing to an area of the
input image.  For example:

		SIZEMGN  IPIC  OPIC  ZOOM=-3  AREA=(10,10,100,100)
is equivalent to
		COPY  IPIC  IDS  (10,10,100,100)
		SIZEMGN  IDS  OPIC  ZOOM=-3

The output data format may be different from the input format (see OFORM
keyword).  The image DNs may be optionally rescaled at this point via parameter
SCALE.  Note that rescaling may be necessary when converting to a smaller data
format (e.g. halfword-to-byte).  If a sample value is outside the range of the
output format (e.g. 0 to 255 DN for byte data), the output DN will be truncated.
The output DN range may be further limited via the LIMITS parameter.

.page
SPECIFYING THE SIZE OF THE OUTPUT IMAGE:

The size of the output image is specified either by entering the number of
lines and samples in the VICAR size field, or by specifying a magnification
or compression factor via the ZOOM, LZOOM, or SZOOM parameters:

Ex:  Enlarging a 3x3 image to a 9x9 image can be achieved in the
     following equivalent ways:

		SIZEMGN  A  B  SIZE=(1,1,9,9)
        or      SIZEMGN  A  B  NL=9  NS=9
	or	SIZEMGN  A  B  ZOOM=3
        or      SIZEMGN  A  B  LZOOM=3  SZOOM=3

If the output image size is specified by entering the number of lines and
samples, then the ZOOM factor is determined by computing the ratio between
the output and input picture dimensions.  Independent ZOOM factors are
computed in the line and sample dimensions, and may result in a change in
the image aspect ratio:

	z1=NLO/NLI		z2=NSO/NSI

where the input image size is NLI x NSI and the output image size is NLO x NSO.
The computations are performed in floating point, so that the output picture
size is not necessarily a multiple of the input picture size (i.e. z1 and
z2 are floating-point numbers).

The ZOOM factors may be specified via the ZOOM parameter,
		    ZOOM=z
where z1=z2=z, or independently via the LZOOM and SZOOM parameters:
		LZOOM=z1  SZOOM=z2

When the zoom factor is an integer, it is identical in function to the ZOOM
option in program XVD.  If z is positive, the input picture size
is multiplied by z.  If z is negative, the picture size is divided by -z.
Note that z=-2 is equivalent to z=0.5.

Specification of a zoom factor does not override the corresponding NL and/or 
NS values in the VICAR SIZE field.  If a value of NL or NS is specified that 
is smaller than ZOOM*(input NL or NS), then the image will be truncated in
that dimension.  If greater, then a blank area will be appended on the
bottom or right edge, respectively.

The IOFFSET parameter may be used to start the output image at a (line,sample)
coordinate other than (1,1).  Let the input image be:

                           1  2  3
                           2  3  4
                           3  4  5

then
		SIZEMGN  INP  OUT  NL=8  NS=8  ZOOM=2  IOFFSET=(2,2)  'NOIN

will result in the following:

                    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
                    0  1  1  2  2  3  3  0
                    0  1  1  2  2  3  3  0
                    0  2  2  3  3  4  4  0
                    0  2  2  3  3  4  4  0
                    0  3  3  4  4  5  5  0
                    0  3  3  4  4  5  5  0
                    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

IMAGE MAGNIFICATION:

The following example illustrates how image magnification is treated. Let
the input picture A be a 3x3 image as follows:

			       2  5  8
			A  =   5  8 11
			       8 11 14

The statement
		SIZEMGN  A  B  SIZE=(1,1,9,9)  'NOIN
	or	SIZEMGN  A  B  ZOOM=3  'NOIN

will produce a 9x9 output image B by replicating each input sample into a
3x3 pixel area:

		       2  2  2  5  5  5  8  8  8
		       2  2  2  5  5  5  8  8  8
		       2  2  2  5  5  5  8  8  8
		       5  5  5  8  8  8 11 11 11
		B  =   5  5  5  8  8  8 11 11 11
		       5  5  5  8  8  8 11 11 11
		       8  8  8 11 11 11 14 14 14
		       8  8  8 11 11 11 14 14 14
		       8  8  8 11 11 11 14 14 14

The statement
		SIZEMGN  A  B  SIZE=(1,1,9,9)  ZOOM=3

will produce a 9x9 output image by interpolating between the four nearest
neighbors and extrapolating around the picture borders.

		       0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
		       1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
		       2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
		       3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
		B  =   4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
		       5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13
		       6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14
		       7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
		       8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

As in the no-interpolation case above, each input sample has been "blown up"
to fill a 3x3 area.  However, because interpolation is performed, the input
sample values equal the output sample values only at the geometric centers
of these 3x3 areas.

Note that the magnified image output by SIZEMGN differs slightly from what one
might obtain using GEOM, MGEOM, or GEOMA. The user may find it instructive
to attempt to achieve an identical result as the example above by using GEOM
or GEOMA.

.page
IMAGE COMPRESSION:

Image compression is treated as the functional inverse of image magnification.
Unless the keyword 'NOIN is specified, the compression is performed via area
averaging.  To illustrate, let picture B be the 9x9 image of our previous
example:

		       0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
		       1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
		       2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
		       3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
		B  =   4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
		       5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13
		       6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14
		       7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
		       8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

The statement:
		SIZEMGN  B  C  ZOOM=-3

will cause each output pixel to be computed by averaging a 3x3 area of
the input image.  For example, output pixel (1,1) = (0+1+2+1+2+3+2+3+4)/9
The resulting output image C will be identical to our original input image A:

			       2  5  8
			C  =   5  8 11
			       8 11 14

The area averaging operation is extended to non-itegral zoom factors by
assigning fractional weights to samples around the area margins, and unit
weights to interior samples. The output sample is then the weighted samples
divided by the sum of their weights.

If the keyword 'NOIN is specified,

		SIZEMGN  IPIC  OPIC  ZOOM=-N  'NOIN

then no pixel interpolation is performed.  The output image is generated
by selecting every Nth image line from IPIC, and every Nth pixel of each of
these lines, begining with pixel (1,1).  Note that when the output picture
is several times smaller than the input picture, most of the samples in the
input image are ignored in the generation of the output image.

To illustrate, let picture B be the 9x9 image of our previous example:

		       0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
		       1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
		       2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
		       3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
		B  =   4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
		       5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13
		       6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14
		       7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
		       8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

The statements:
		SIZEMGN  B  C  ZOOM=-3  'NOIN
		SIZEMGN  B  D  ZOOM=-3  'NOIN  AREA=(2,2,8,8)

will generate 3x3 output images C and D of the form:

		0  3  6		       2  5  8
	 C  =	3  6  9		D  =   5  8 11
		6  9 12		       8 11 14

Note the use of the AREA parameter to begin the resampling at a point other
than pixel (1,1).

The input image may be compressed by a non-integral zoom factor r:

		SIZEMGN  IPIC  OPIC  ZOOM=r  'NOIN

where r is a floating point number between 0 and 1.  Each output sample is
generated by determining where it comes from in the input image and selecting
the sample closest to this point.

.page
UPDATING OF MAP PROJECTION LABEL INFORMATION:

If the input image has map projection labels, the projection information
will be updated to reflect changes in the geometry as a result of size
changes and image offsets (see AREA and IOFFSET parameters).  A new map
projection history label is added and the map projection property label
is updated.

If the map projection is POINT PERSPECTIVE, the following label items are
recomputed:

    FOCAL_PLANE_SCALE
    OPT_AXIS_INTERCEPT_LINE
    OPT_AXIS_INTERCEPT_SAMPLE
    PLANET_CENTER_LINE
    PLANET_CENTER_SAMPLE

For all other projections, the following label items are recomputed:

    LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET
    SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET
    MAP_SCALE
    MAP_RESOLUTION

If either MAP_SCALE or MAP_RESOLUTION is missing from the input projection
label, it is computed from the other using the relationship: 

                      PI
     MAP_RESOLUTION = --- * A_AXIS_RADIUS/MAP_SCALE
                      180

.page
EXAMPLES:

Let the input image be a 100 x 100 byte picture. The following equivalent
statements will magnify the input image by a factor of 2.5:

		SIZEMGN  A  B  SIZE=(1,1,250,250)
		SIZEMGN  A  B  ZOOM=2.5

To blow up a 50x50 area from the center of the picture by a factor of 4:

		SIZEMGN  A  B  ZOOM=4  AREA=(26,26,50,50)

To average all the lines of an image together, use

		SIZEMGN  A  B  NL=1

The following equivalent statements magnify the line direction by 2 and
shrinks the sample direction by 2:

		SIZEMGN  A  B  SIZE=(1,1,200,50)
		SIZEMGN  A  B  LZOOM=2  SZOOM=-2

.page
MAGELLAN SPECIFIC OPTIONS:

Special code has been added to SIZEMGN to convert Magellan data to units of
volts before compressing the image.  The pixels are subsequently converted
back to DN prior to output.  Both input and output images must be in byte
format.  The input image must contain more than one sample per line.
The Magellan option is implemented for image compression and integral ZOOM
values only.  The NOIN, LIMITS and SCALE parameters are illegal with this
option.

The Magellan option is currently implemented using two competing algorithms:
If keyword 'LOOKUP is specified, the program uses tables input from external
files to convert the input samples from DNs to voltages and to convert the
output samples from voltages to DNs.  If the keyword 'VOLTS is specified,
the program performs the conversions using tables computed internally.  The
'LOOKUP algorithm is 20 percent faster, but introduces a random error of 0.5 DN
with a maximum error of 20 DN.  The error is greatest at low DN levels.

The next two sections describe the LOOKUP and VOLTS keywords.
.page
LOOKUP KEYWORD:

If the 'LOOKUP keyword is specified, the DN-to-volts and volts-to-DN tables
are read from files specified by the DVDATA and VDDATA parameters.  Both lookup
tables may be generated via VICAR procedure SIZELOOKUP.  If defaulted, files
MGNSIZED.DAT and MGNSIZEV.DAT are read from MGNLIB.

The DN-to-volts table is in fullword (INTEGER*4) data format and contains
256 entries (for DNs 0 to 255).  The entries in this table are assumed to be
non-negative.  The table must be input from a file in standard VICAR image
format, consisting of one line of 256 samples.

The Volts-to-DN table is in byte format and contains at least N entries, where
N is the maximum value stored in the DN-to-volts table (N < 1250000).

Ex:    SIZEMGN  IPIC  OPIC  ZOOM=-3  'LOOKUP
  Lookup tables MGNSIZED.DAT and MGNSIZEV.DAT are automatically accessed from
  directory MGNLIB.

Ex:    SIZELOOKUP  OUT_DIR=DEV:[JOE123]
       SIZEMGN  IPIC  OPIC  ZOOM=-4  'LOOKUP +
	  DVDATA=DEV:[JOE123]MGNSIZED.DAT +
	  VDDATA=DEV:[JOE123]MGNSIZEV.DAT

  The procedure SIZELOOKUP is used to compute external lookup tables
  MGNSIZED.DAT and MGNSIZEV.DAT in directory DEV:[JOE123].  The DVDATA and
  VDDATA parameters are used to input these files to SIZEMGN.

.page
VOLTS KEYWORD:

If the 'VOLTS keyword is specified, conversion tables are computed internally
using the following formulas:
	a)  v = 10**((d-b)/a)
        b)  d = a*logv + b
where v=volts, d=DN, a=slope, b=offset.  The slope and offset may be specified
via the SLOPE and OFFSET parameters.

The volts-to-DN conversion is accomplished by computing a 2250 entry logrithmic
table.  When the default slope (50) is used, this table introduces a 0.1 DN
random error, with a maximum error of 1 DN.  Larger slopes will result in 
correspondingly larger errors.

.page
PROGRAM RESTRICTIONS:

Both IPIC and OPIC may be up to 20,000 pixels in width (sample size) and of
arbitrary length (line or vertical dimension).

The input image may be on tape or disk.  However, the output image must be on
random-access disk storage.

.LEVEL2
.VARI INP
    Ex:  INP=IPIC
where IPIC is the input image file specification.  IPIC may be
in byte, halfword (16-bit integer), fullword (32-bit integer), or floating
point (REAL*4) data format.  IPIC may be up to 20,000 pixels in width (sample
size) and of arbitrary length (line or vertical dimension), and may be
located on disk or magnetic tape.
.VARI OUT
    Ex:  OUT=OPIC
where OPIC is the output image file specification.  The output data format is
specified by the OFORM parameter.  OPIC may be up to 20,000 pixels in width
(sample size) and of arbitrary length (line or vertical dimension), and must
be located on random-access disk storage.
.VARI SIZE
    SIZE=(1,1,NL,NS) 
where NL and NS specify the number of lines and samples in the output image.
If the SIZE parameter is ommitted, the output image size should be specified
via the ZOOM, LZOOM, and/or SZOOM parameters.

    Ex: Enlarging a 3x3 image to a 9x9 image can be achieved in the
        following ways:

		SIZEMGN  A  B  SIZE=(1,1,9,9)
        or      SIZEMGN  A  B  NL=9  NS=9
	or	SIZEMGN  A  B  ZOOM=3
        or      SIZEMGN  A  B  LZOOM=3  SZOOM=3
.VARI NL
    NL=n
where n is an integer specifying the number of lines in the output image.
The parameters NL and NS may be used instead of the SIZE parameter to specify
the size of the output image.
.VARI NS
    NS=n
where n is an integer specifying the number of samples in the output image.
The parameters NL and NS may be used instead of the SIZE parameter to specify
the size of the output image.
NOTE: The same restrictions that pertain to the SIZE parameter also pertain
to NL and NS.(See HELP SIZE)
.VARI OFORM
Keyword OFORM specifies the data format of the output image.  Valid values
are BYTE for byte output, HALF for halfword (16-bit integer) output, FULL
for fullword (32-bit integer) output, and REAL for 32-bit floating-point
output.  If defaulted, the output data format is set equal to the input
data format.
.VARI LOOKUP
Keyword 'LOOKUP is a Magellan specific option specifying the use of lookup
tables to convert the input samples from DNs to voltages and to convert the
output samples from voltages to DNs.  The lookup tables are input from files
specified via parameters DVDATA and VDDATA (see below).

Both input and output images must be in byte format.  The input image must
contain more than one sample per line.

LOOKUP is implemented for image compression and integral ZOOM values only.
The NOIN keyword is illegal with this option.

.VARI AREA
    AREA=(SL,SS,NL,NS)
where SL, SS, NL, and NS are all integers specifying the starting line,
starting sample, number of lines, and number of samples, respectively, of
the input area. The input area defaults to (1,1,NLI,NSI) where NLI and NSI
are the number of lines and number of samples in the input image.

.VARI IOFFSET

The IOFFSET parameter may be used to start the output image at a (line,sample)
coordinate other than (1,1).  Let the input image be:

                           1  2  3
                           2  3  4
                           3  4  5

then
		SIZEMGN  INP  OUT  NL=8  NS=8  ZOOM=2  IOFFSET=(2,2)  'NOIN

will result in the following:

                    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
                    0  1  1  2  2  3  3  0
                    0  1  1  2  2  3  3  0
                    0  2  2  3  3  4  4  0
                    0  2  2  3  3  4  4  0
                    0  3  3  4  4  5  5  0
                    0  3  3  4  4  5  5  0
                    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

Generating blank margins may be useful in a mosaic or for writing an OVERLAY
grid.

This option is not allowed with the Magellan-specific LOOKUP and VOLTS
keywords.

.VARI NOIN
NOIN specifies that no interpolation is to be performed.  A nearest
neighbor is used to compute each output sample value. The default is to
perform interpolation.
.VARI ZOOM
    ZOOM=z
where z is an integer or floating point number specifying the output image
size as a ratio of the input image size (the zoom factor).  The image size
is scaled by the factor z in both line and sample dimensions.  Note that
the line and sample zoom factors may be specified independently via the
LZOOM and SZOOM parameters.  I.e. ZOOM=2 is equivalent to LZOOM=2 SZOOM=2.

The zoom factor is identical in function as in VIDS or IDX. If z is
positive, the input picture size is multiplied by z.  If z is negative,
the picture size is divided by -z.  Note that z=-2 is equivalent to z=0.5.
Specification of a zoom factor overrides the corresponding NL and/or NS
values in the VICAR SIZE field.  If a zoom factor is not specified the
output picture size defaults to the corresponding NL and/or NS value in
the SIZE field.
.VARI LZOOM
    LZOOM=z
where z is an integer or floating point number specifying the magnification
or reduction factor of the image in the line (vertical) dimension.  If z is
positive, the line dimension is multiplied by z.  If z is negative, the line
dimension is divided by -z.  Note that z=-2 is equivalent to z=0.5.

Specifying LZOOM overrides the corresponding NL value in the VICAR SIZE
field.  If LZOOM is not specified the output line dimension defaults to the
corresponding NL value in the SIZE field.
.VARI SZOOM
    SZOOM=z
where z is an integer or floating point number specifying the magnification
or reduction factor of the image in the sample (horizontal) dimension.  If z
is positive, the sample dimension is multiplied by z.  If z is negative, the
sample dimension is divided by -z.  Note that z=-2 is equivalent to z=0.5.

Specifying SZOOM overrides the corresponding NS value in the VICAR SIZE
field.  If SZOOM is not specified the output line dimension defaults to the
corresponding NS value in the SIZE field.
.VARI SCALE
    SCALE=s
where s is an integer or floating point number specfying an optional
scaling to be applied to the output DN values: OUTDN=s*OUTDN.  If SCALE
is not specified, no scaling is performed.
.VARI LIMITS
  LIMITS=(I1,I2)
where I1 and I2 are integers specifying the lower and upper limits of the
output DN range. All DN's outside this range are set equal to ILO and IHI.
The defaults are 0 and 255 for byte output, -32768 and 32767 for halfword
output, and -2147483648 and 2147483647 for fullword data.  This DN range
check is applied to floating point output.
.VARIABLE VDDATA
VDDATA specifies a table lookup file for converting voltages to DNs.
This is a Magellan-specific option.  See help file for details.
.VARIABLE DVDATA
DVDATA specifies a table lookup file for converting DNs to voltages.
This is a Magellan-specific option.  See help file for details.
.VARI VOLTS
Keyword 'VOLTS is a Magellan specific option which causes the input DN values
to be converted to volts prior to image compression and the results to be
converted back to DN prior to output.  Both input and output images must be in
byte format.  The input image must contain more than one sample per line.

The conversion formulas are as follows:
	a)  v = 10**((d-b)/a)
        b)  d = a*logv + b
where v=volts, d=DN, a=slope, b=offset.  The slope and offset may be specified
via the SLOPE and OFFSET parameters.

VOLTS is implemented for image compression and integral ZOOM values only.
The NOIN keyword is illegal with this option.
.VARI SLOPE
See VOLTS for further details
.VARI OFFSET
See VOLTS for further details
.VARI DEBUG
Print the following message while the status returned from routine MP_LABLE_READ
is less than MP_SUCCESS: "error reading MP labels or MP labels do not exist"
